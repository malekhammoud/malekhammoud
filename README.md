## AI Chat configuration

Create `.env.local` in the project root (this file is git-ignored) and add:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_ai_studio_api_key
# Optional, override default model (defaults to gemini-pro)
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-1.5-flash
```

Note: Do not prefix with quotes. Ensure there are no trailing spaces.

Run the health check to verify envs are loaded:

- GET `/api/chat/health` returns `{ ok: true, model, keyPreview }` if the key is present.
- GET `/api/chat/models` lists supported model names for your key.

If you see `API_KEY_INVALID` errors, rotate your key in Google AI Studio and update `.env.local`. On Vercel or other hosting, set the same env vars in the dashboard.
